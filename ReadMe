For part 3, you need to:
1. run: rails db:migrate
2. run: rails db:seed (because we create some objects for you to try our complain page)
3. run: rails s and then enter to localhost:3000/start_page/home_page (this is our static start page)
4.We havent created any posts so you have to create one to see how the post index works but we created the User, Super_Admin, Admin and a Wall so you only have to run: rails db:seed to start creating posts
5.For a new post you need to use User: 1, Super_Admin_id = 1, Admin_id = 1 and Wall_id = 1

Enjoy our page!!
